Chapter 3 notes:

Labels - in the assembler are symbolic names to addresses in a program.
.balign 4 - ensures that the next address will start a 4-byte boundary.
	    possibly creates padding bytes. 
.data - This section allows allows modification to data/variables.
myvar1 - represents a relocaton of the variable (load01.s).
Load/Store - different manners to compute an address
Patching - the address of 'addr_of_myvar1' is pathched during the linking 
	   phase (when creating the executable)
