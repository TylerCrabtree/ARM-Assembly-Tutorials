Chapter5 notes:

branch - creates/interprets different sequences of instructions 
special register -r15 is a special register. Usually refered to as pc.
pc - program counter
ip - instruction pointer (another name for the pc) 
Note: If instructions do not modify the pc, the pc is incremented by 4.
      If the pc is modified, the counter is pc + 4
cmp - used for branching, can act as a conditional case
Note: Values of registers contain condition flags:
	N - Negative
	Z - Zero
	C - Carry
	V - Overflow
	

EQ - used for equal (z is 1, Z is enabled)
NE - not equal (z is 0, Z is disabled)
GE - greater or equal (V and N are enabled or disabled)
LT - lower than (V and N are both not enabled or disabled)
GT - greater than (Z is 0 and N is V, Z is disabled, N and V are either both enabled/disabled)
LE - lower or equal (Z is 1. If not N is V, Z is enabled)
MI - minus or negative (N is 1 N is enabled)
PL - plus (N is 0 and enabled)
VS - overflow is set (V is 1 V is enabled)
VC - overflow is clear (V is 0 V is disabled)
HI - higher (C is 1 and Z is 0 and C is enabled)
LS - lower or same (C is 0 or Z is 1 C is disabled and Z is enabled)
CS/HS - Carry set or same (C is 1 and C is enabled)
CC/LO - carry clear or lower (C is 0 and disabled)
